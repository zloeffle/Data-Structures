'''
Practice using various data structures
'''

'''
Array
'''

'''
2D array
'''

'''
Linked List
- Uses: constant time is needed for insert/delete, data grows dynamically, no random access, insert at any position
'''

'''
Circular Linked List
- Uses: deck of cards, browser cache, most recently used list, undo functionality
'''

'''
Double Linked List
- Uses: Easy deletion, reverse iteration
'''

'''
Stack LIFO
- Uses: rexpression eval, correct path in maze
'''

'''
Queue FIFO
- Uses: when order is needed, add/removing both ends
'''

'''
Binary Tree 
'''

'''
Binary Search Tree
'''

'''
Heap
- Uses: quick access to smallest/largest elem, selection algorithms (mix/min)
'''

'''
Hash Table
- Uses: constant time operations, slow inserts & fast reads
'''

'''
Graph
- Uses: shortest path/optimal route, solving mazes
